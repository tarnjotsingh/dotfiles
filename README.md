# dotfiles

Fork of Kartik's dotfile git repo that includes my own modifications to the files and file structure.

List of changes to i3 config
1. Add "position top" into the bar {..} section to put the i3bar on the top
2. add a new line "new_window pixel 1" to create windows that have next to no border; increasing use of screen real estate.

# Dependencies
Will keep adding to this as a figure what else is essential.
Once I've compiled all this information together, I might go ahead and make an RPM/Arch Package

imagemagick
i3gaps
i3blocks
alsa-utils (using volume module in i3gaps)
rofi
